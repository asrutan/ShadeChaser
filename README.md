# ShadeChaser
Unity Project ShadeChaser
CREATED: asrutan 3/5/18
MODIFIED: asrutan 3/5/18

For this version, I've reworked most of the scripts to allow for easier adding of features. 
When the player touches the light, they are killed and respawned with a new shader.

Warning to anyone adding or removing triggerhurts, changing the number of total triggers might cause errors or crashing.

CHANGES
-Attempted to re-organize folders
-Created helper GameObjects to track global variables.
-The player spawn is now a gameobject to allow for respawning with different models/variables.
-Changes behind the scenes for the hurt triggers.
-Plenty of miscellaneous groundwork for later features.


NOTES
-Projectiles need to despawn after a limit of time or amount is reached.
-I'm pretty sure this breaks enemy AI at the moment.
